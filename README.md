# Collab-AI-Foundation SIP Gateway (gateway)

**License:** Apache License 2.0 (see LICENSE file for details)

**Introduction**

This project provides an open-source SIP gateway written in Go, designed to integrate web services with SIP communication. It acts as a bridge between the SIP network and HTTP-based web APIs, enabling applications to exchange messages using SIP protocols.

**Features**

*   Connects SIP User Agents (UAs) to web services using HTTP requests.
*   Parses and generates SIP messages.
*   Supports basic message forwarding between SIP and web service endpoints.
*   Built with Go for performance and concurrency. (Uses the [SipGo](https://github.com/emiago/sipgo) library)

**Getting Started**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Go development environment (version 1.x or higher)
    *   Git version control system

2.  **Installation**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Collaboro-AI-Foundation/gateway.git](https://github.com/Collaboro-AI-Foundation/gateway.git)
    cd gateway
    go mod vendor
    ```

3.  **Running the Gateway**

    This project uses the `cmd` directory structure for executables. To run the gateway:

    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/gateway
    ```

**Usage**

The gateway acts as an intermediary for SIP messages between SIP UAs and your web service.

*   **SIP UAs** communicate with the gateway using standard SIP protocols (e.g., MESSAGE).
*   The gateway **translates** incoming SIP messages into HTTP requests and sends them to your web service endpoint.
*   Your web service processes the request and generates a response.
*   The gateway receives the response from the web service and translates it back into a SIP message, forwarding it to the intended recipient.
